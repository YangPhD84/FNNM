# FNNM
Our study shows that, in many applications, the to-be-complete matrix can be represented as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix associating with side information matrices. The low-rank matrix depicts the global patterns while the sparse matrix characterizes the local patterns, which are often described by the side information. Accordingly, to achieve high-quality matrix completion, we propose a Feature and Nuclear Norm Minimization (FNNM) model. FNNM has demonstrated promising results on a variety of applications, including movie recommendation, drug-target interaction prediction, and multi-label learning. The codes are implemented in Matlab.
